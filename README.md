## ðŸ‘‹ Hello! It's Joe.

[Here](https://helloitsjoe.github.io/newsletter-links/joe) are some things I'm
reading, and [here](https://helloitsjoe.github.io/blog) are some things I'm
writing.

I've also written a few things for the Wayfair Tech Blog:
- [What is Auxiliary Engineering?](https://www.aboutwayfair.com/tech-innovation/what-is-auxiliary-engineering)
- [Frontend + k8s = a Match Made in h4n](https://www.aboutwayfair.com/careers/tech-blog/frontend-k8s-a-match-made-in-h4n)

I also co-host [Runtime Rundown](https://runtimerundown.com) with [@cooperbuilt](https://github.com/cooperbuilt) and sometimes I [build things on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmoQaM-x1zBKCUUPS5e6fCA).
